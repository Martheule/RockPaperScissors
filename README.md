##This is an exercise for WBS Coding School.

## Tools I Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Where?
https://github.com/Martheule/RockPaperScissors

## Instructions for developing this
*The project must be completed individually without teammates.
*Use a single public GitHub repository, kept public for instructor code inspection. No instructors added as collaborators.
*PRs only
*During the final presentation, the student must explain their code line by line to the class. (RIP ME)
*Create a command-line Rock Paper Scissors game that: takes the player’s input from process.argv, randomly generates computer moves, determines the winner, and outputs the result.
